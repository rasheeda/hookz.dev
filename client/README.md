# About This Project

hookz.dev is a free and open source web tool to help developers quickly test webhooks or catch and inspect all http requests.

The front and backend are split. The backend respository can be found [here](https://github.com/rasheeda/hookz.dev.backend)

The application is built in [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) and relies on APIs provided by the backend service to create and display hookz data.

Please refer to the backend code for more information on how the frontend interfaces with that service.
